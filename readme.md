## GRE applet

Just a little window thingy with buttons to record your answers as you practice GRE sets.

Dependencies:
- python and PySimpleGUI library 
To install the library on linux, use pip:
```
pip install PySimpleGui
```

Features:
- Navigation with prev/next buttons
- Keeps track of time you spent on each question
- Reads in correct answers once the test is done and shows result
- logs report on to a file

Missing:
- can't yet select multiple answers for single question
- would be nice to not depend on terminal at all
- haven't tested in Windows
